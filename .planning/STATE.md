## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Extension type getters (e.g., TwSpace.s4.all) are NOT const-evaluable -- API docs must clarify this limitation
- [Roadmap]: Token files are independent leaf nodes and can be built in parallel within Phase 2
- [Roadmap]: INF-04 (unit tests) assigned to Phase 2 so tests are written alongside token/theme code, not deferred

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- alchemist compatibility with Flutter 3.19 needs verification before Phase 5 golden tests
- very_good_analysis Dart ^3.11 dev dep constraint -- verify non-transitive to consumers on Dart 3.3
